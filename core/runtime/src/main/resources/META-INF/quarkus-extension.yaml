description: |
  Quarkus Flow is the CNCF Workflow Specification implementation engine to the Quarkus ecosystem. 
  The CNCF specification is an open-source, vendor-neutral, community-driven project that redefines workflow creation through its high-level Domain Specific Language (DSL).
  
  In this extension, we deliver the runtime engine for Java Enterprise, covering both general workflows and Agentic AI (see quarkus-flow-agentic) use cases for Java developers.

  The current implementation is based on the CNCF Java SDK.
