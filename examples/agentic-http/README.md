# Agentic HTTP example

This module contains the **agent + HTTP** example used in the Quarkus Flow workshop.

It is the _canonical_ source for the `InvestmentMemoFlow` example – the docs module mirrors
these sources so they can be included in the documentation and compiled during the docs build.

## Documentation

For step-by-step instructions, explanations, and lab exercises, see the Quarkus Flow workshop:

- Workshop overview: https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-flow/dev/wk-index.html
- Agentic lab (LangChain4j + HTTP): https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-flow/dev/wk-lab-4-agentic-langchain4j.html

Always refer to the workshop docs for how to run and extend this example.
