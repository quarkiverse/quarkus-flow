= Quarkus Flow workshop
:page-role: tutorial
include::../includes/attributes.adoc[]

This workshop is a guided, hands-on path through the main Quarkus Flow features.
Each lab builds on the previous one, but you can also run them independently.

You will:

* Bootstrap a Quarkus project and run a first workflow using the Java DSL.
* Explore the Flow Dev experience: Dev UI, logs, tracing, and data output.
* Call external HTTP and OpenAPI services from workflows.
* React to and emit events using messaging (Kafka or another connector).
* Orchestrate AI agents (LangChain4j) with agentic workflows.

== Prerequisites

* Java and Maven installed (same versions as your Quarkus project).
* Quarkus CLI or Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`).
* A recent Quarkus version compatible with Quarkus Flow.
* For the optional labs:
** HTTP/OpenAPI: a running demo endpoint (the guides use small, local examples).
** Messaging: Kafka (or another SmallRye connector) – Dev Services is enough.
** Agentic: a LangChain4j backend (Ollama, OpenAI, …).

== Labs

The workshop is split into four labs:

. xref:workshop/lab-1-hello-flow-devui.adoc[Lab 1 – Hello Flow & Dev UI] +
Create a Quarkus app, add Quarkus Flow, write a first workflow with the Java DSL, and run it via REST and Dev UI.

. xref:workshop/lab-2-http-openapi.adoc[Lab 2 – Call HTTP & OpenAPI services] +
Extend the app with HTTP and OpenAPI tasks, configure the HTTP client, and observe errors through the Problem Details mapper.

. xref:workshop/lab-3-events-yaml.adoc[Lab 3 – Events with YAML workflows] +
Introduce a YAML-based workflow that reacts to events from messaging, and emit CloudEvents back out.

. xref:workshop/lab-4-agentic-langchain4j.adoc[Lab 4 – Agentic workflows] +
Wire LangChain4j agents into a Flow, add a simple critique/approve loop, and discuss human-in-the-loop patterns.

Each lab is short and focused so you can run it in ~15–20 minutes and still see the full feature in action.

== Where to look for the code

The snippets in these labs reference the link:{docs-repo}[same example code] used across the documentation:

* Java classes under {docs-repo} (for example `org/acme/HelloWorkflow.java`).
* YAML workflows under {docs-repo}/flow.

You can copy-paste them into your own project or simply follow along in your editor.
