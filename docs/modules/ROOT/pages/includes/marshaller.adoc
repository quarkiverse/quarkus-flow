=== Add model marshaler

In order to be able to write and read the workflow model to/from the persistence store, Quarkus Flow requires the presence of an implementation of `io.serverlessworkflow.impl.marshaller.CustomObjectMarshaller` interface capable of marshaling the workflow model.

By default, the underlying `WorkflowModel` implementation is based on Jackson, therefore following dependency should be added together with the persistence plug-in one.
