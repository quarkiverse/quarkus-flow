:description: Workflow engine for Quarkus based on the CNCF Workflow Specification, with Java DSL and Agentic AI support.

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]


Quarkus Flow is a lightweight, native-friendly workflow engine for Quarkus, built on the link:https://serverlessworkflow.io/[CNCF Workflow Specification].
It lets you model classic workflows and Agentic AI orchestrations, with first-class CDI/Quarkus ergonomics.

== Highlights

* CNCF-compliant workflows via a fluent Java DSL
* Build-time discovery of workflow descriptors and injection of compiled beans
* Agentic workflows with link:https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-langchain4j/dev/index.html[LangChain4j]
* Messaging support with link:https://quarkus.io/guides/messaging[SmallRye]
* HTTP Client support with link:https://resteasy.dev/[RESTEasy Reactive].

== When you’d use it

* **You’re already on Quarkus** and want orchestration without leaving your stack (CDI, Dev Services, config, build-time optimization).
* **You need deterministic, debuggable flows** in Java—code-reviewable, testable, and observable—rather than opaque or bespoke DSLs.
* **You want agentic AI orchestration** beside regular services (LangChain4j agents as first-class tasks: call, critique, loop, HITL).
* **You prefer CNCF alignment** so your workflow concepts match an open specification and aren’t locked into a closed runtime.
* **You need fast start & low memory** for container/serverless deployments (Quarkus + native image friendly).
* **You want compile-time discovery** of flows for safer wiring and simpler DI (`Flow` subclasses discovered at build time).

== Why Quarkus Flow?

* **Reduce time-to-market for automations**:
Model cross-service processes (APIs, events, agents) with a consistent DSL and Quarkus dev-mode feedback.

* **Lower operational risk**:
Typed Java flows + unit/integration tests + Quarkus observability = fewer production surprises.

* **Govern AI interactions**:
Encode guardrails (critique/revise loops, compliance checks, HITL steps) as explicit tasks and transitions.

* **Improve portability & longevity**:
Concepts map to the CNCF Workflow Spec, lowering re-platforming cost and vendor lock-in.

* **Orchestration in the same language/runtime as services**:
Developers implement and review workflows in Java, using familiar Quarkus tooling and CI.
* **Compliance & auditability of automated decisions**:
Flows are explicit code; reviews, tests, and logs provide traceability for audits.
* **Human-in-the-loop (HITL) control for AI**:
Encode pause/review/approve steps and event-driven resumes to keep humans in control.
* **Resilience & recoverability**:
Declarative retries, error paths, and event listeners make failure behavior predictable.
* **Observability & supportability**:
Integrates with Quarkus metrics/logging; flow boundaries make SRE triage easier.
* **Performance & scalability in cloud environments**:
Quarkus native compatibility supports fast startup and high density for microservices/serverless.
* **Standards alignment**:
Tasks, events, data mapping, and transitions align with the CNCF Workflow Specification to ease long-term maintenance.
* **Extensibility for AI & integrations**:
LangChain4j agents, HTTP/OpenAPI calls, and messaging tasks can be combined in one model.

== Typical use cases

* **Back-office automation:** approval chains, enrichment, notifications, SLAs with retries and timeouts.
* **Agentic AI pipelines:** draft → critique → revise loops with compliance checks and HITL reviews.
* **Service orchestration:** call multiple microservices (OpenAPI/HTTP), correlate events, and emit domain events.
* **Event-driven processes:** wait for external signals (e.g., “review.required”), then resume with captured context.

== How it compares (high-level)

The landscape is rich; here’s a brief, opinionated snapshot to help positioning. This is not exhaustive—evaluate with your team’s constraints.

[%autowidth,cols="1,2,3,2,2"]
|===
|Project |Model & runtime |Strengths |Consider when… |Fit vs Quarkus Flow

|**Temporal**
|Code-first workflows (SDKs in several languages) with a separate Temporal Cluster (services: History/Matching/Frontend). Durable timers/queues built-in.
|Excellent reliability story (durable execution, retries, signals), strong developer experience for long-running workflows.
|You’re fine running a dedicated Temporal cluster and adopting its programming model/SDK; language polyglot is important.
|**Quarkus Flow** keeps everything in your Quarkus app with CDI & build-time discovery, and aligns with the CNCF Workflow concepts. You avoid running a separate orchestration control plane.

|**Camunda 8**
|BPMN 2.0 (diagram-first) with Zeebe engine; separate SaaS/self-managed control plane; Java/Polyglot workers.
|Business-friendly diagrams, mature ecosystem, monitoring/ops tooling out of the box.
|You want BPMN for stakeholder collaboration and can operate Zeebe/Console (or use SaaS).
|**Quarkus Flow** favors code-first (fluent Java) and CNCF alignment; lighter footprint inside your Quarkus services; easier to unit test alongside code.

|**Netflix Conductor**
|JSON/YAML workflow definitions; server orchestrator + workers (HTTP/GRPC); strong microservice orchestration patterns.
|Good for service orchestration with pluggable tasks and external workers; battle-tested at scale.
|You’re comfortable with an external orchestrator and JSON/YAML modeling + worker model.
|**Quarkus Flow** keeps models and tests in Java, integrates tightly with CDI/Quarkus, and adds agentic AI/HITL patterns while mapping to CNCF concepts.

[TIP]
====
Nothing stops you from a **hybrid** approach:

- Use **Quarkus Flow** for in-service workflows, developer-centric testing, and **agentic AI/HITL** loops tightly coupled to your Quarkus modules.
- Use a **centralized orchestrator** (Temporal/Camunda/Conductor) for enterprise-wide, cross-language processes or when you need their managed ops and dashboards.
