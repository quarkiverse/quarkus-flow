= Lab 1 – Hello Flow & Dev UI
:page-role: tutorial
include::includes/attributes.adoc[]

In this lab you:

* Create (or reuse) a Quarkus app.
* Add the Quarkus Flow extension.
* Write a minimal workflow using the Java DSL.
* Invoke it via REST and inspect it in Quarkus Dev UI.

== 1. Create the Quarkus project

If you don’t have a project yet, use the Quarkus CLI:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus create app org.acme:hello-flow \
  --extension=resteasy-reactive-jackson,io.quarkiverse.flow:quarkus-flow
cd hello-flow
----

Or add RESTEasy Reactive with JSON to an existing project.

== 2. Create a minimal workflow

Create a `Flow` subclass that returns a simple greeting.
For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}org/acme/HelloWorkflow.java[]
----

This workflow builds a simple `do` sequence with one task that sets `message = "hello world!"`
and returns it as the workflow output.

== 3. Expose it through REST

Create a REST resource that injects the workflow and starts an instance:

[source,java]
----
include::{examples-dir}org/acme/HelloResource.java[]
----

Key points:

* The resource injects the `HelloWorkflow` class directly.
* `startInstance()` starts the workflow and returns a `CompletionStage`.
* The method returns `CompletionStage<String>` so the endpoint stays non-blocking.

== 4. Run in dev mode

Start Quarkus in dev mode:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

Test the endpoint:

[source,shell]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
----

You should see a JSON output similar to:

[source,json]
----
{"message":"hello world!"}
----

== 5. Explore Quarkus Dev UI

With dev mode still running, open the Dev UI in your browser:

* `http://localhost:8080/q/dev` or `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui` (depending on Quarkus version).

Look for the **Flow** card (if available in your version). From there you can:

* Inspect available workflows.
* Trigger them with custom input data.

Even without a dedicated card, you can:

* Hit the REST endpoint from the Dev UI *REST Client* panel (if you expose an OpenAPI description).
* Watch logs and tracing output as the workflow runs.

== 6. What you learned

* Quarkus Flow discovers `Flow` subclasses at build time and makes them injectable.
* You can expose workflows through normal Quarkus REST endpoints using `CompletionStage`.
* Dev UI gives you a convenient front-end for iterating on workflows while in dev mode.
